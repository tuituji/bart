The source code for parsing, animation, and
textures are located in

----------------------------------------------
src/ is all source 
*.jpg are some pictures generated by this raytracer
Input files(mainly some texture pictures) are too large and do not upload here
For more info, visit http://pan.baidu.com/s/1jGiNhga


Build & run on Linux:
cd src
make
cp raytracer ../kitchen
cd ../kitchen
./raytracer kitchen.aff image

output in directory image

Make film:
cd image
convert *.ppm kitchen.mpg


!!!!Moving the camera is still not corret.
